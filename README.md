They either lack the technical skills to build modern websites, can't afford expensive agencies, or end up with generic templates that don't reflect their unique brand. This digital gap limits their ability to attract clients, grow revenue, and compete in an increasingly online-first economy.

### 7.2 Customer Segments

Unlike DIY builders, we offer custom design and real developer support. Unlike agencies, we're affordable and fast. We bridge the gap — professional results without the enterprise cost.

- **Coding bootcamps & workforce development programs** (graduate portfolio services)
