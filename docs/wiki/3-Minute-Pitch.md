## 1. Problem

Many freelancers, small business owners, and early-stage entrepreneurs struggle to establish a professional online presence. They either:

- Lack the technical skills to build modern websites
- Can't afford expensive agencies
- End up with generic templates that don't reflect their unique brand

**This digital gap limits their ability to attract clients, grow revenue, and compete in an increasingly online-first economy.**

## 2. Customer Segments

- **Freelancers & independent professionals** (developers, designers, consultants, artists)
- **Local small businesses** lacking web presence (restaurants, salons, repair shops)
- **Nonprofits and early-stage entrepreneurs** with limited budgets
- **Bootcamp graduates** needing portfolios to land their first jobs
